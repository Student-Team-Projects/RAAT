# X2Go for Android

The goal of this project is to create a mobile app providing similar experience as connecting to a [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/) or [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php) server, but communicating through [RFB protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6143.html) rather than NX protocol. Currently, only Linux (preferably Arch Linux) is supported on the server side, and the server tool is avaialable here (TODO).

This code is based on the [AVNC](https://github.com/gujjwal00/avnc) project.
